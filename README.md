# ost-client-ios-sdk

## Introduction

Wallet SDK is a mobile application development SDK that enables our partner companies to
- Key Management
- Safely generate and store keys on the mobile device
- Encrypt the wallet keys.
- Sign ethereum transactions and data as defined by contracts using EIP-1077.
- Signed transactions needed for activities such as adding, authorizing and removing keys.
- Signed data is needed to execute actions on the blockchain.


These digital signatures ensure that users have complete control of there tokens and these tokens can only be transferred with their explicit or implicit consent.
    
## Support

- iOS version : 9.0 and above (**recommended version 10.3** )
- Swift version: 4.2

## Quick Setup

- Get [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) by running `brew install carthage` or choose [another installation method](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/#installing-carthage)
- Create a [Cartfile](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md#cartfile) in the same directory where your `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` is
- Specify OstWalletSdk in [Cartfile](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md#cartfile)

```
github "ostdotcom/ost-wallet-sdk-ios" "v0.1.0-beta.1"
```

- Run `carthage update --platform iOS`
- A `Cartfile.resolved` file and a `Carthage` directory will appear in the same directory where your `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` is
- Open application target, under `General` tab, drag the built `OstWalletSdk.framework` binary from `Carthage/Build/iOS` into `Linked Frameworks and Libraries` section.
- On your application targetsâ€™ `Build Phases` settings tab, click the _+_ icon and choose `New Run Script Phase`. Add the following command

```sh
/usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks
```

- Click the + under `Input Files` and add an entry for each framework:

```
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/Alamofire.framework
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/BigInt.framework
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/CryptoEthereumSwift.framework
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/CryptoSwift.framework
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/EthereumKit.framework
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/FMDB.framework
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/SipHash.framework
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/OstWalletSdk.framework
```
- Create `OstWalletSdk.plist` file. Following is the default configurations. 

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
 <plist version="1.0">
 <dict>
 <key>BlockGenerationTime</key>
 <integer>3</integer>
 <key>PricePointTokenSymbol</key>
 <string>OST</string>
 <key>PricePointCurrencySymbol</key>
 <string>USD</string>
 <key>RequestTimeoutDuration</key>
 <integer>30</integer>
 <key>PinMaxRetryCount</key>
 <integer>3</integer>
 <key>SessionBufferTime</key>
 <integer>3600</integer>
 </dict>
 </plist>
```

- _BlockGenerationTime_: The time in seconds it takes to mine a block on auxiliary chain.
- _PricePointTokenSymbol_: This is the symbol of base currency. So it's value will be OST.
- _PricePointCurrencySymbol_: It is the symbol of quote currency used in price conversion.
- _RequestTimeoutDuration_: Request timeout in seconds for https calls made by ostWalletSdk.

- _SessionBufferTime_: Buffer expiration time for session keys in seconds.

## OstWalletSdk apis

To use Ost wallet sdk use `import OstWalletSdk`

### Initialize

To get started with the SDK, you must first initialize SDK by calling _initialize()_ api.
It initializes all the required instances and run migrations of db. 
        
```Swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
